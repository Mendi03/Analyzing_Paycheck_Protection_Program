# Introduction
 
This is a project made in the span of 2 weeks analyzing the fairness of the Paycheck Protection Program using government datasets. This was made for the [Arkansas Summer Research Institute](https://www.arkansasedc.com/science-technology/division/data-analytics-that-are-robust-trusted-(dart)/arkansas-summer-research-institute) in 2022.

## Hypothesis

The hypothesis I ended up going with is: **_"Having a small business in an urban area in the U.S. increases the amount of money loaned and loans forgiven as the number of employees increases"_**

## Analysis

The data was divided into businesses loaned over 150K and businesses less than 150K.

Number of entries are as follows:

- Businesses loaned over 150k
  - Rural entries = 136192
  - Urban Entries = 738629
 


- Businesses loaned less than 150k
  - Rural entries = 365688
  - Urban Entries = 978972
